# Task-Management-Tool

This project is a solo-curated full stack to-do list application.

## Languages

The languages I've used in creating this project are `Javascript`, `HTML`, `SCSS`, and `Shell`.

## Description

Hello, my name is Neel and this application I made is a full stack to-do list. Meaning you can create tasks, edit them, as well as delete them. I've also incorporated a user register and login function to the application in where you can register as a user and log in to create tasks only meant for you to see and access. As an individual who is extremely organized, this application was created to help those struggling to keep organized and also to help those who are already organized to be even further organized.

## Development Setup

Since this application is deployed, for you to access the application, all you need to do is go to this link https://task-management-tool1.herokuapp.com/ and you then will be able to use the app freely. Upon clicking the link, you should see a page like such.

> **Note**
> You can't login with a user just **yet** because I haven't been able to fix an issue, however, you can register and your information will be saved to the database at least.

### Issues

The only current issue with the application is as stated above; you can not login with your user credentials just **yet** but that issue is being attempted to be fixed as you're reading this. Also, this isn't so much an issue but I'm also going to spend further time styling to create a better and more appealing user experience for you.
